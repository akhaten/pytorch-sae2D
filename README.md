[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/akhaten/pytorch-sae2D)

This a wrapper for 3D segmentation architecture.

You can use link to Colab to run model but you will think to change device (gpu more fast than cpu) in your settings. When you click on colab badge, select run.ipynb (you dont need clone repo because there is an colab integration implemented in first cell of notebook).
